# Repeating Tasks Manually
#### Before we write our own loops letâ€™s take a moment to develop an appreciation for loops. The best way to do that is by showing you how cumbersome it would be if a repeated task required you to type out the same code every single time.

> Example Code
```js
const vacationSpots = ["Niagara Falls", "Banff National Park", "Toronto's CN Tower"];

console.log(vacationSpots[0]); // Prints 'Niagara Falls'
console.log(vacationSpots[1]); // Prints 'Banff National Park'
console.log(vacationSpots[2]); // Prints 'Toronto's CN Tower'
```
