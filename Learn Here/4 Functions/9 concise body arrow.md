# Concise Body Arrow Functions

JavaScript also provides several ways to refactor arrow function syntax. The most condensed form of the function is known as *concise body*. Weâ€™ll explore a few of these techniques below:

1. Functions that take only a single parameter do not need that parameter to be enclosed in parentheses. However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.

2. A function body composed of a single-line block does not need curly braces. Without the curly braces, whatever that line evaluates will be automatically returned. The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow `=>` and the `return` keyword can be removed. This is referred to as *implicit return*.

So if we have a function:
```js
const squareNum = (num) => {
  return num * num;
};
```
We can refactor the function to:
```js
const squareNum = num => num * num;
```
Notice the following changes:

- The parentheses around `num` have been removed, since it has a single parameter.
- The curly braces `{ }` have been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
- The `return` keyword has been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
