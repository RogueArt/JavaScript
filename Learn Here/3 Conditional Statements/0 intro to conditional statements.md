# What are Conditional Statements?

These if-else decisions can be modelled in code by creating conditional statements. A *conditional statement* checks a specific condition(s) and performs a task based on the condition(s).

In this lesson, we will explore how programs make decisions by evaluating conditions and introduce logic into our code!

Weâ€™ll be covering the following concepts:

- `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
- comparison operators
- logical operators
- truthy vs falsy values
- ternary operators
- `switch` statement
