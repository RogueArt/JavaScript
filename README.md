# Introduction
 Last year, millions of students began their programming journey with JavaScript. Why JavaScript you ask? JavaScript is *the* language of modern web browsers. Through twenty years of evolution, JavaScript has evolved into a powerful, flexible, and fast programming language with many uses in web development, servers, desktops, and many other platforms.

 Since JavaScript remains at the core of web development, it’s often the first language learned by self-taught coders eager to learn and build. We’re excited for what you’ll be able to create with the JavaScript foundation you'll gain here. In fact, the use of JavaScript is so prevalent, that it even powers the dynamic behavior of our own website!

 In this lesson, you'll learn introductory coding concepts including data types and built-in objects—essential knowledge for all aspiring developers. Make sure to take notes and pace yourself. A strong foundation will set you up for understanding the more complex concepts you’ll encounter later.
